♦ Django Application
This directory consists of the django made application of our work. Where a user can upload the video and submit it to the model for prediction. The trained model performs the prediction and the result is displayed on the screen.

♦ Model Creation
This directory consists of the step by step process of creating and training a deepfake detection model using our approach.

♦ Documentation
This directory consists of all the documentation done during the project
